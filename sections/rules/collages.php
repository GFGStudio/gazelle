    <ul>
      <li>
      Collection vandalism is taken very seriously, resulting in collection editing privileges being removed (at a minimum).
      </li>
      <li>
      A well-defined group of people, for instance Counter Culture Labs members, may create a Group Picks Theme collection with one pick per person, after having gained permission for the collection from Staff.
      </li>
      <li>
      There may only be one collection per Theme. Dupe collections will be deleted. The collection that is allowed to stay will be determined at staff discretion, with priority given to the most well maintained and oldest collection.
      </li>
      <li>
      Theme collections must be sensible, and reasonably broad. Those that do not fit this description will be deleted.
      </li>
      <li>
      Collections are <strong>not</strong> an alternative to the tagging system. A collection such as "fungi torrents" wouldn't be allowed, because it is far more appropriate to just tag the torrents as fungi. Of course, a "fungi rRNA barcodes" collection would be looked upon differently.
      </li>
      <li>
      Collections should not be used to create lists of an artist's works, as the artist pages already exist for this purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
      Every collection must have at least 3 torrent groups in it, except for collections of type "Personal" and "Staff Picks."
      </li>
      <li>
      Check to see that a similar collection does not already exist. If a similar collection does exist, please contribute to the existing collection.
      </li>
      <li>
      Give your collection an appropriate title and a decent description explaining its purpose.
      </li>
      <li>
      Attempt to add a cover image to every torrent in your collection.
      </li>
